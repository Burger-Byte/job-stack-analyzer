Phase 1: Research & Planning (2-4 weeks)

Architecture Design:

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Python with FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching
Task Queue: Celery for async job processing
Deployment: Docker

Legal & Ethical Research:

Study job board Terms of Service (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, AngelList)
Implement respectful scraping (rate limiting, robots.txt compliance)
Consider using official APIs where available (LinkedIn has limited access)

Phase 2: Data Collection System (4-6 weeks)
Web Scraping Infrastructure:
Tools: Scrapy/BeautifulSoup + Selenium for dynamic content
Target Sites: Indeed, Glassdoor, AngelList, company career pages
Data Points: Job title, description, required skills, company, location, salary
Anti-Detection Measures:

Rotating proxies and user agents
Random delays between requests
CAPTCHA solving services for complex sites
Distributed scraping across multiple servers

Phase 3: Data Processing & Analysis (3-4 weeks)
Skills Extraction Engine:

Natural Language Processing using spaCy or NLTK
Create comprehensive tech stack dictionary (React, Python, AWS, etc.)
Context-aware extraction (distinguish "Java" programming from "Java" coffee)
Machine learning model to improve accuracy over time

Data Normalization:

Standardize job titles (Frontend Developer, Front-end Engineer â†’ Frontend Developer)
Clean and categorize skills (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Databases, etc.)
Remove duplicates and outliers

Phase 4: Dashboard Development (4-5 weeks)
Frontend Features:

Search/filter by job title
Interactive charts showing skill percentages
Trend analysis over time
Regional comparisons
Skill demand forecasting

Key Visualizations:

Bar charts for top 10 required skills per job title
Pie charts for skill category breakdowns
Time series for emerging vs declining technologies
Heat maps for geographic skill demand

Phase 5: Deployment & Optimization (2-3 weeks)
Performance Optimization:

Database indexing for fast queries
CDN for static assets
Caching frequently accessed data
Progressive web app features

Technical Challenges You'll Face
1. Anti-Scraping Measures

Sites actively block scrapers
Solutions: Residential proxies, browser automation, API partnerships

2. Data Quality

Job descriptions vary wildly in format
Solutions: Multiple extraction algorithms, manual validation samples

3. Scale & Performance

Processing thousands of job postings daily
Solutions: Async processing, cloud infrastructure, efficient algorithms

4. Legal Compliance

Respecting website terms of service
Solutions: Rate limiting, robots.txt compliance, consider partnerships

Recommended Learning Path
Month 1-2: Core Skills

Python web scraping (Scrapy tutorial)
Database design (PostgreSQL fundamentals)
API development (FastAPI or Django REST)

Month 3-4: Advanced Topics

Natural Language Processing basics
React.js for dashboard development
Docker containerization

Month 5-6: Deployment & Scaling

Cloud platforms (AWS/DigitalOcean)
Monitoring and analytics
Performance optimization

MVP Strategy
Start small with a focused MVP:

Single job board (Indeed - most permissive ToS)
5-10 popular job titles (Software Engineer, Frontend Developer, etc.)
Top 20 technologies (JavaScript, Python, React, etc.)
Basic dashboard with charts and filters

This approach lets you validate the concept, learn the technical challenges, and build an audience before scaling to the full vision.
